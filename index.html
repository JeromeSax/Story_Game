    <h1>The Choice Within</h1>

            <p>Welcome to the music business kid. 
                You finally made it to the big stage. You
                hit a million followers on Delayagram, hit 100 million
                streams on Flopify & PearMusic, and built a solid fan base. Now 
                you have some choices to make. You can stay independent
                and keep slowly building, but it won't be easy as you've already
                seen. You'll encounter barriers and trials that will test
                your inner artistry. ALAS there is another solution!
                You can sign with a music label and they'll knock down 
                all those barriers and trials will be a thing of the past. Both
                come at a cost though. Stay true to yourself and art or sell your soul
                and become a music icon? What will you choose?
