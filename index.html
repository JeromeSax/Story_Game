            <h1>The Choice Within</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to the music business kid. You finally made it to the big stage. 
                You finally have 100 thousand followers on Delayagram, hit 1 million streams
                on Flopify & PearMusic, and built a solid fan base. Now you have some 
                choices to make. You can stay independent and keep slowly building, but it won't
                be easy. You'll encounter barriers and trials that will test your inner artistry. 
                BUT there is another solution! You can sign with a music label and they'll 
                knock down all those barriers. Trials will be a thing of the past.
                Both choices come at a cost. Decisions...decisions. Throughout the story you
                will be presented with different scenarios that lead you down different paths.

                <h1>Chapter 1: <br> Dreams & Decisions</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
                <p> You have a record deal on the table. 
                    Taking the deal allows you to create and 
                    fund your first big album and get a feature. 
                    In truth you've never been crazy about the idea
                    of features in your music. In fact you would much 
                    rather continue to make music with local artists
                    and your current band members. Even though they aren't 
                    the most talented bunch you have great chemistry and
                    these are your friends. You have been supporting each other
                    for years. Then again its always been your dream
                    to make it big in music. Now that you have been presented with this big 
                    opportunity you can definitely make this all work.  
                    Or can you? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
                    The record label that wants to sign you is none other
                    than <strong> UrScrewed Music Group</strong>. One of the biggest labels out
                    there! They don't have the best track record for treating 
                    their artists the best but they have access to some of the best
                    artists, producers, and musicians that money can buy. 
                    Most importantly they have the ultimate distribution network.
                    Their marketing team is second to NONE! You can be sure that
                    everyone will hear your music. The catch is that the record deal 
                    is ironclad. You won't be able to record with your friends anymore 
                    and you'll have to take the feature they provide you with. And lets 
                    not forget the money. They are offering a 10 million dollar record 
                    deal. Money talks and right now your pockets are quiet...sheesh couldn't 
                    be me. But hey this is your decision to make. I mean how long can you 
                    survive on ramen noodles and PB&J sandwiches? This deal is worth right? 
                    Sign the contract and choose your feature or pass on the deal. 
                    All of your choices will have consequences. 
                    Choose wisely!</p>

                <h1>Chapter 2: <br>Back To Reality</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
                <p> You have either taken the Record deal or turned down the offer. 
                    If you took the Record deal make the best of the opportunity. 
                    Very few artists make it this far in their career. 
                    You landed a big feature and now its time to capitalize on that.
                    You worry that your music is changing and doesn't represent
                    you, but it's too late to back out now. That contract was serious 
                    business. If you walk away now you'll lose the money and your music 
                    and that is not an option. The label has an idea that could potentially
                    double your streams. Thats a good thing right? I mean more streams
                    means that more people are listening. The music is a little different
                    but change isn't always a bad thing. What will you do?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
                    If you turned the deal down its back to square one. NEWS FLASH!
                    Making music isn't cheap and you are low on funds. Time to dig
                    deep and get creative in how you brand yourself as an artist.
                    One of the harshest realities of being an artist is that bringing
                    your ideas and creations to life require funding. You want to escape
                    the mundane repitition of a 9-5 job but you need cash. Music equipment
                    cost money, paying your band members cost money, recording your music
                    cost money, and most importantly YOU HAVE BILLS TO PAY! Rent isn't cheap and food 
                    isn't free. You have to get yourself out of survival mode and back into 
                    creative mode. So how are you gonna do that and make money? Maybe 
                    Mom and Dad will have the answer you're looking for. One thing is for sure. 
                    People are definitely listening to your music but the finacial burden is wearing you down.
                    It's time to make a choice!</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
                <p>The music industry isn't what you thougt it would be. You barely recognize
                   yourself anymore. You started off with relatable music that really told a Story.
                   Now because of the label your music is trending in the pop category with artists
                   you despise. The music has lost what made it special and has become what you call
                   "bubblegum". It looks pretty, catches peoples attention, tastes sweet, but ultimately
                   loses its flavor very quickly. This is not your art and the record label is constantly 
                   pushing you to release new music every month. The idea that you have to consistently drop
                   music all the time to stay relevant is apparently the norm with this label. All hope isn't 
                   lost though. The money you have made is more than you've ever had. You can afford to travel 
                   anywhere now. You finally bought your parents that house and seeing their reaction was 
                   priceless. Financially you are free but something is missing. Perhaps it's the slimeball
                   record executives always telling you what to do, or maybe its these new crazy fans 
                   that are always bothering you on social media. Nothing is the same. Was this all worth it?
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
                   Being an Independent artist has revealed somethings to you. Music and creative freedom come
                   with a cost. Wether it be time or resources you realize it was never gonna be easy.
                   Consistency has been your bestfriend in this journey and it has yielded some decent results.
                   Combine that with the support of friends and family, you're doing ok. The new content you made 
                   is a big hit and grown your fan base. The problem is that this has barely made a dent in your bills.
                   Picking up a part time job wasn't the worst thing ever but finding balance in your work life and music
                   isn't easy. It's almost as if there's a contant push and pull effect taking place in your life. You are 
                   constantly being pushed by the world to share your creations and music but the financial burden of 
                   paying for these projects always pulls you back to a job. You are either going to fold are stay on the
                   path. What will you do? 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Scenario 3</h2>
                   Mom and Dad are thrilled to have you back home! And wouldn't you know it? Dad found you a job at the local 
                   warehouse! Blowing your back out for $18 an hour and pizza parties every 3 months? You my friend are living
                   the <strong>DREAM.</strong>Years have gone by and you have lost many of the fans and followers you worked
                   so hard to gain. On the bright side you're living rent free, your bank account isn't in the negative, and you
                   have your old bedroom back...yay? The problem is that you still have the itch for creativity deep in your soul.
                   You have to find a way to get back to the music, to the CREATIVITY! There's a local bar in town and every week 
                   it is packed with people looking for good music and a good time. Your mind starts to wander. What if this is your chance? You still
                   have some skill. There are plenty of people out there that remember how talented you were. Can you make a comeback?
                   This might be the redemption arc in your story. It's time to make a choice.
