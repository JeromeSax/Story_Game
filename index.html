            <h1>The Choice Within</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to the music business kid. You finally made it to the big stage. 
                You finally have 100 thousand followers on Delayagram, hit 1 million streams
                on Flopify & PearMusic, and built a solid fan base. Now you have some 
                choices to make. You can stay independent and keep slowly building, but it won't
                be easy. You'll encounter barriers and trials that will test your inner artistry. 
                BUT there is another solution! You can sign with a music label and they'll 
                knock down all those barriers. Trials will be a thing of the past.
                Both choices come at a cost. Decisions...decisions.

                <h1>Chapter 1: <br> Dreams & Decisions</h1>
                <p> You have a record deal on the table. 
                    Taking the deal allows you to create and 
                    fund your first big album and get a feature. 
                    In truth you've never been crazy about the idea
                    of features in your music. In fact you would much 
                    rather continue to make music with local artists
                    and your current band members. Even though they aren't 
                    the most talented bunch you have great chemistry and
                    these are your friends. You have been supporting each other
                    for years. Then again its always been your dream
                    to make it big in music. Now that you been presented with this big 
                    opportunity you can definitely make this all work.  
                    Or can you? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The record label that wants to sign you is none other
                    than UrScrewed Music Group. One of the biggest labels out
                    there! They don't have the best track record for treating 
                    their artists the best but they have access to some of the best
                    artists, producers, and musicians that money can buy. 
                    Most importantly they have the ultimate distribution network.
                    Their marketing team is second to NONE! You can be sure that
                    everyone will hear your music. The catch is that the record deal 
                    is ironclad. You won't be able to record with your friends anymore 
                    and you'll have to take the feature they provide you with. And lets 
                    not forget the money. They are offering a 10 million dollar record 
                    deal. Money talks and right now your pockets are quiet...sheesh couldn't 
                    be me. But hey this is your decision to make. I mean how long can you 
                    survive on ramen noodles and PB&J sandwiches? This deal is worth right? 
                    Sign the contract and choose your feature or pass on the deal. 
                    All of your choices will have consequences. 
                    Choose wisely!</p>

                <h1>Chapter 2: <br>Back To Reality</h1>
                <p> You have either taken the Record deal or turned down the offer. 
                    If you took the Record deal make the best of the opportunity. 
                    Very few artists make it this far in their career. 
                    You landed a big feature and now its time to capitalize on that.
                    You worry that your music is changing and doesn't represent
                    you, but it's too late to back out now. What will you do?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you turned the deal down its back to square one. NEWS FLASH!
                    Making music isn't cheap and you are low on funds. Time to dig
                    deep and get creative in how you brand yourself as an artist.
                    Try to find a way to get your music out there to the fans!</p>
