This is a short story game about the life and trials of and independent artist. There two paths and one alternate route the user can take in this story. The user is presented with scenarios followed by choices that give an outcome based on the choices made. There are 3 chapters with 9 choices and a conclusion section giving an overall outcome. 

The game can be found on Git hub: https://github.com/JeromeSax/Story_Game

The problems that occured during the creation of this game were generating the choices for each scenario. More choices will be added and possibly more chapters to give different outcomes.
