This is a short story game about the life and trials of an independent artist. There two paths and one alternate route the user can take in this story. The user is presented with scenarios followed by choices that give an outcome based on the choices made. There are 3 chapters with 9 choices and a conclusion section giving an overall outcome. 

Each chapter covers a section of the players life. They could either choose to remain independent and face the hardships that come with that or take the path with the record label. Signing with a record label seems like the best option at first but upon reading the story the player will see that it comes with consequences.

Chapter 1 is the setup. The player is presented with the foundational choices. There are 2 scenarios. The first one is the path they can take with the record label. The second one is the path they can take as an independant artist. There are 3 choices. The third choice leads down a path not shown in the beginning. The player won't know what the third choice is for until the later chapters.

Chapter 2 is the reality section. The player is presented with the consequences and benefits of their choices.

Chapter 3 is the final section. It expands upon the scenarios showing the player how their life has turned out with the choices made. It has a bit of a twist ending that shows a third path to the player.

The conclusion section shows the overall outcome for each scenario.

The problems that occured during the creation of this game were generating the choices for each scenario. More choices will be added and possibly more chapters to give different outcomes. Sound will also be added to the buttons when the player clicks on them. Locking the other buttons when the player clicks on a choice is also a feature that can be added.
